      <description>Hi, welcome to my blog! I am Daniel Daeyeon Kim and I am an international student from South Korea at Carleton College, Northfield, MN - Class of 2023. I major in Computer Science and also recently started to explore Statistics, which led me to work at Carleton ITS DataSquad as a current student programming assistant. My primary interests in CS are building user-friendly services and learning new skills or languages, and I am planning to expand my interests more and more!</description>
