      <description>Hi! I came back with another simple bash shell script for organizing the file directories. I was keep working on my leetcode practice as usual, and this time I got annoyed by creating a new directory for problem each time I solve. My repository has a structure like below:
└── problem_type1 ├── problem_1 │ └── Problem.md │ └── problem_1.js ├── problem_2 │ └── Problem.md │ └── problem_2.js │ problem_type2 ├── problem_1 │ └── Problem.</description>

      <description>Hi! This would be my first blog post on this new setting. I do have some posts on my previous blog, but that&amp;rsquo;ll take some time to migrate everything at once. I am probably going to update those whenever I&amp;rsquo;m available, so hope you enjoy my other posts later!
For this one, I wanted to share my first experience in writing a simple shell script that reduces your time whenever you try to push something to Github.</description>
