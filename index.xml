      <description>Hi! This would be my first blog post on this new setting. I do have some posts on my previous blog, but that&amp;rsquo;ll take some time to migrate everything at once. I am probably going to update those whenever I&amp;rsquo;m available, so hope you enjoy my other posts later!
For this one, I wanted to share my first experience in writing a simple shell script that reduces your time whenever you try to push something to Github.</description>

      <description>Hi, welcome to my blog! I am Daniel Daeyeon Kim and I am an international student from South Korea at Carleton College, Northfield, MN - Class of 2023. I major in Computer Science and also recently started to explore Statistics, which led me to work at Carleton ITS DataSquad as a current student programming assistant. My primary interests in CS are building user-friendly services and learning new skills or languages, and I am planning to expand my interests more and more!</description>
